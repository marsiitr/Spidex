# Abstarct 
The idea was to create a bot which imitates the motion of a spider with the help of six legs.The motion of a single leg had to be different then the typical ‘dog motion’.
# Motivation 
The main reason to create this bot was to overcome the difficulty faced by wheeled robots to move on rough surfaces .On an even advanced level  the bot could also be used to walk on really steep  surfaces or overcome the obstacles kept in its path by simply moving its legs over it which wheeled robots could not do. 
# Mechanical aspect of the design 
The bot has an hexagonal body to which the six  legs are attached on the edges.A single leg has two motors attached to it so as to make a total of 12 motors.two motors are used in a leg so as to provide  motion in what we call as y and z direction and thus successfully imitating the motion of a single spider leg .The arduino is mounted on a platform made out of thermocol on the centre of the bot .all legs were 3d printed and the hexagonal body was made out of MDF board.
# Electronic aspect of the design 
The motion and all the activites of our bot is govreened by a MEGA ARDUNIO which has a capacity to drive about 40 servo motors and our bot uses 12 servo motors. Each leg having two of them to provide two degree of freedom per leg. ONce the code is uploaded in the arduino the spidex begins to move according the algorith that we have defined in our code. Our code is written in C++ language and we have used servo library of this language.

# Applications 
The bot can be used for military purposes as well as domestic functions.it can be used as an excellent tool to carry load from one place to the other even over rough surfaces thus finding many applications in all sectors. 
# Future improvements 
Adding various sensors so as to detect obstacles.  .
Controlling the bot  via a remote control.
