<h2> Abstarct </h2> 
<p> The idea was to create a bot which imitates the motion of a spider with the help of six legs.The motion of a single leg had to be different then the typical ‘dog motion’. </p>
<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> The main reason to create this bot was to overcome the difficulty faced by wheeled robots to move on rough surfaces .On an even advanced level  the bot could also be used to walk on really steep  surfaces or overcome the obstacles kept in its path by simply moving its legs over it which wheeled robots could not do. </p>
<h2> Mechanical aspect of the design </h2>
<p> The bot has an hexagonal body to which the six  legs are attached on the edges.A single leg has two motors attached to it so as to make a total of 12 motors.two motors are used in a leg so as to provide  motion in what we call as y and z direction and thus successfully imitating the motion of a single spider leg .The arduino is mounted on a platform made out of thermocol on the centre of the bot .all legs were 3d printed and the hexagonal body was made out of MDF board.</p>
<h2> Electrical aspect of the design </h2>

<h2> Cost structure </h2>

  <li> Cost structure </li>
  <li> Additional cost </li>
  <li> Jumper wires </li>
  <li> Screws nuts and bolts-49 </li>
</ol> 
<h2> Applications </h2>
<p> The bot can be used for military purposes as well as domestic functions.it can be used as an excellent tool to carry load from one place to the other even over rough surfaces thus finding many applications in all sectors. </p>
<h2> Future improvements </h2>.
<p> Adding various sensors so as to detect obstacles  .
Controlling the bot  via a remote control </p>
